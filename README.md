## üöÄ Getting Started

You can deploy Lively locally for development or personal use.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- `pnpm` (or `npm`/`yarn`)

2.  **Install dependencies:**

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following keys.

    ```env
    # Azure AI Services for Translation & general AI
    AZURE_ENDPOINT=YOUR_AZURE_ENDPOINT
    AZURE_LOCATION=YOUR_AZURE_LOCATION
    AZURE_API_KEY=YOUR_AZURE_TRANSLATOR_API_KEY

    # Azure AI Services for Speech Recognition
    AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=YOUR_AZURE_SPEECH_KEY
    AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=YOUR_AZURE_SPEECH_REGION

    # Supabase (Optional: for logging, feedback, and usage stats)
    # You can opt-out of the backend if you don't need this functionality.
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

    # Usage Limits (Optional)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_LOCAL_CHARS_PER_DAY=10000
    NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_GLOBAL_CHARS_PER_DAY=100000
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

- **Run the development server:**

  ```bash
  pnpm run dev
  ```

- **Build for production:**

  ```bash
  pnpm build
  pnpm start
  ```

- **Format the code:**
  ```bash
  pnpm exec prettier --write .
  ```

## üîß Customization

- **Text & UI**: Most user-facing text descriptions are defined in `src/lib/definitions.ts`.
- **Languages**: The list of supported languages is located in `src/lib/languages.ts`. You can find the full list of languages supported by Azure here:
  - [Translator Language Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/language-support)
  - [Speech Service Language Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=stt)

### A Note on Speech Synthesis

The text-to-speech (TTS) functionality is currently handled by `react-speech-kit`, which relies on the Web Speech API. This means voice availability and quality depend on the user's browser. For the best experience, **Microsoft Edge** is recommended, followed by Chrome and Safari.
