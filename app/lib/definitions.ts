    "Whoever you are, I would like to sincerely thank you for trying out Lively. It all begins when I joined KubeCon earlier in 2024, where they had live translations for many of their sessions. I figured that this should not be too difficult to implement, but at the same time there are not a lot of open source projects that do this. Therefore, I decided to build a one-stop solution for live translations, focusing solely on translating conversations, whether it is for your own use, conversations, and presentations.",
